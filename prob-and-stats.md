## Hypotheses


### Type one error

If you have committed a type one error you have concluded that
a phenomenon exists when in fact it does not.

### Type two error

If you have committed a type one error you have concluded that a
phenomenon does not exist when in fact it does.

### Bonferroni

When we test multiple hypotheses on the same data, the type 1 error
rate increases for each hypotheses added. The Bonferroni correction
is used to adjust the p-values in order to counteract this effect.
This is done by multiplying the p-values by the number of
hypotheses tested. A downside of applying Bonferroni correction is
an increase in type two error, since the correction makes the
criterion for rejecting the null hypotheses more strict, and we may
therefore end up disregarding valid contrasts between samples.
